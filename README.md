# Insecticide Resistance Modelling (IR Mapper Dataset)

## Overview
This project analyzes global insecticide resistance trends in *Anopheles* mosquitoes using publicly available WHO/CDC bioassay data from IR Mapper.  
It demonstrates expertise in epidemiological data science, spatial analysis, and mixed-effects modelling.

---

## Objectives
- Model temporal trends in insecticide resistance  
- Compare insecticide classes and countries  
- Visualize global and country-specific trends  
- Generate GIS maps for public health insights  

---

## Dataset
- Source: IR Mapper (WHO & CDC bioassay dataset)  
- Records: 7,562 covering multiple African countries (2010–2020)  
- Variables include: species, percent mortality, insecticide tested, coordinates, year, assay type

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **R** (tidyverse, glmmTMB, sf, ggplot2)  
- Mixed-effects modeling of bioassay data  
- Spatial data analysis and mapping  
- Data cleaning, visualization, and reproducible workflow  
- GitHub for version control and portfolio management
